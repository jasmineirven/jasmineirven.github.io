    <h1> Understanding Live Webpages</h1>
    <h2> What is Atom? </h2>
    <p> Atom is a code editor. This is a desktop application which forms a platform for creating webpages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In order to use this application, go to <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">atom.io</a> and click the download
        button.
    </p>

    <p> Once you have installed Atom, you can begin to write code which can be viewed locally on your computer. However this code is not a live webpage, and therefore is not useable or viewable by third parties.</p>

    <h2> What is GitHub? </h2>
    <p> <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is a web-based hosting service used to hold user repositories. Once you have created an account on GitHub, you can create a repository of your own. Name your repository as follows: <span> username.github.io </span>.
        This repository is linked to a webpage hosted by GitHub where you will be able to view your live page once everything is set up. </p>

    <p> You can now clone your folder and place this on your desktop or in a folder on your computer, so that you have a local copy of the repository file.</p>

    <p> <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank"> GitHub for Desktop </a> is a local application which allows you to coordinate and sync your local page with the remote live webpage. Download this from the
        <a href="https://desktop.github.com/"
            target="_blank"> GitHub Desktop </a> website and open it on your computer. This allows you to update your live webpage more easily. Any changes made in your local html file (located in Atom), can be viewed in Git for Desktop. This application also allows you to
            commit these changes and then sync them to your live webpage so that the page is continually updated. Each time you do this you are creating a new version of the website, so don't forget to put something in the summary forum before committing
            the changes to the webpage. You can also add a description of the changes if you like. Git itself, is software which tracks changes made locally. </p>
