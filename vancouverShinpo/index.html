    <h1> Nav Drop-Down Design </h1>
    <p>
        To condense the number of tabs a drop-down menu will be used. This is an example of what the menu would look like if you were to hover over the news item tab. If you hover over one of the drop-down tabs the letters will turn red to indicate that it is
        a link.

    <h1> Mobile Design </h1>
    <p>
        This is what will appear when you open the home page of the mobile design. The layout is condensed for easy scrolling.
